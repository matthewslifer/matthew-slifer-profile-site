    <h2>Tic Tac Toe Game</h2>
    <h3><a href="https://github.com/matthewslifer/tic-tac-toe">Github Link</a></h3>
    <p>This simple of game of Tic Tac Toe was created using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. The first player starts as Player X and the second player starts as Player O. This project demonstrates further knowledge with Javascript and HTML. To play the game, simply open the interface.html file on a browser!</p>

    <h2>Personal Profile Site</h2>
    <h3><a href="https://github.com/matthewslifer/matthew-slifer-profile-site">Github Link</a></h3>
    <p>Suprise! The very website you are on right now I coded! This website mostly utilizes HTML and CSS. There is a little bit of JavaScript for the function of the navigation bar. But alas, after many Youtube tutorials later, this is my first "bigger" project.</p>

    <h2>Electric Vehicles and Air Pollution</h2>
    <h3><a href = "Electric Vehicle and Air Pollution.pdf">Project Link</a></h3>
    <p>For my capstone research project at UC Davis, my group and I investigated the impact that electric vehicle usage has on pollution levels for criteria pollutants. We looked at each county in California and compared pollution data provided by the California Air Resource Board. We then compared this to electric vehicle registration by county, with the data being provided by the California DMV. We found that counties that higher rate of EV usage were more likely to have lower pollution levels. We conducted this research by taking large data sets from our sources and running stastical analysis on the data of interest. The graphs were created using Microsoft Excel.</p>

    <h2>Fire Hazard and Vegetation in California</h2>
    <h3><a href="cal-fire-risk.pdf">Project Link</a></h3>
    <p>This project compares fire risk and vegetation type in California. Data was pulled from the CalFire database. We used ArcGIS Pro to develop the map which involved implementing different layers of data. We also ran statiscal analysis to determine which vegetation types had the highest fire risk. This project was done during my undergraduate studies at UC Davis.</p>

    <h2>React Weather App</h2>
    <h3><a href="https://github.com/matthewslifer/React-Weather-App">Github Link</a></h3>
    <p>Welcome to my React.js Weather App! This is a fully functional react app that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to display location, temperature, weather description, feels like temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The search bar is fully functional and to look up weather simply type in the city you want to display weather for. This application utilizes React, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Since this application is not published on the internet, to run it open the git-hub repo on vscode, cd into 'weather-app', open terminal, and type 'npm start'. For security reasons, the API key is removed so the app will not be functional as is. To get the API key, visit https://openweathermap.org/api, click on API > Current Weather Data > Subscribe > and copy and paste your personal key into the denoted space. This application was built following a tutorial by Code Commence. This is my first iteration of the weather app and I plan on implementing the Google Places API to add a list of cities the displays as the user is typing in a location.</p>

    <h2>E-Commerce Application</h2>
    <h3><a href="https://github.com/matthewslifer/E-Commerce-Website">Gituhb Link</a></h3>
    <p>This project is a mock E-Commerce Website that sells headphones, earphones, and speakers. The core technologies of this project include Sanity.io, Next.JS, JavaScript, CSS, implementation of APIs, implementation of dependencies, implementation of packages, and CSS. This project utilizes sanity.io for the backend and management for the database. Sanity.io allows for quick deployment of the backend while making it easy to update and change products on the webpage without having to change any code within this project. The front end of this project was created using Next.JS. Utilizing Next.JS allows for quicker loading times and more efficient code writing. CSS was used to mimick a clean, modern, and user-friendly E-Commerce Website. The payment system is powered by Stripe and demonstates working knowledge using APIs and building code to implement APIs. This project will not work if cloned out of the gate. The dependencies for Sanity were not pushed to the Github repo. The user will need to have Sanity, Next.JS, and npm installed to get the project up and working on a local server. Please checkout my code for this project and let me know of any bugs, issues, or feedback!</p>
