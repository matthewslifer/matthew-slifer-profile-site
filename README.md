Personal profile website for Matthew Slifer.

Website contains homepage, about page, and a portfolio page.

The goal of this website is too create a visually pleasing profile page that has information about Matthew.

The website does not work on mobile devices due to formatting issues.

This is my first bigger project using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS all together.
